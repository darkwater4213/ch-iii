Thomas Jefferson famously decried the British practice of wig-wearing: "For heaven's sake, it makes them look like rats peeping out from bunches of Oakum". He's not wrong. On top of that is the fact that they're terribly uncomfortable, even in temperate weather. In Ghana, where the practice is still very much alive, they're downright miserable. Simply put, the formality brought to the court is not worth the ridiculousness.

The opposition is attempting to claim that this uncomfortable unnecessity is somehow beneficial to the proceedings of court. I ask the Affirmative and judges: in what way? What benefit does it provide that could possibly be worth it? Moreover, must we make it moral obligation? Under what set of circumstances is it reasonable to mandate -- even in a moralistic sense -- some action which provides no substantial benefit, poses many problems and which no one affected yet adheres to _far these selfsame reasons_?!

This brings up another point. If a lawyer truly, honestly believes that a wig will somehow improve his standing or credibility in the court, he can independently choose to wear one. That's the beauty of liberty -- Government or the moral majority need not get involved and make peoples' decisions for them. To make such a moral declaration to the contrary is to forsake everything our country was founded on -- the very principles of British Imperialism that our forefathers forsook. Even down to the wigs in the courts.

### Wearing wigs -- even in the Justice system is a matter of personal choice
