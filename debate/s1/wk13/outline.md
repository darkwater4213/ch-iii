If you ask someone on the street what the cause of the American Civil War was, they'll likely say something about freeing the slaves or keeping the Union whole. <i>They're wrong</i>. If you ere to ask the same people <i>who</i> caused it, they'll almost definitely say the South, when they fired on Fort Sumter. But this time, they're not just wrong -- they're deceived. Hoodwinked.Snookered. Had the cotton pulled over their eyes. <!-- Thanks, Eli! -->
