				If you ask someone on the street what the cause of the American Civil War was, they'll likely say something about freeing the slaves or keeping the Union whole. <i>They're wrong</i>. If you were to ask the same people <i>who</i> caused it, they'll almost definitely say the South, when they fired on Fort Sumter. But this time, they're not just wrong&mdash;they're deceived. Hoodwinked. Snookered. Had the cotton pulled over their eyes. <!-- Thanks, Eli! --> It is true that the South fired first, but they weren't the provokers, and certainly were not the cause. As with most conflicts, it all boils down to politics. But it wasn't the politics of the South and the North&mdash;it was the East and the West.

				On April 1st, 1861, Secretary of State William Seward wrote a memo requesting action against "European intervention". The Civil War had not yet begun. “I would at once demand explanations from France and Spain categorically,” Seward wrote. “I would demand explanations from Great Britain and Russia&hellip; And if satisfactory explanations are not received from Spain and France, I would convene Congress and declare war against them.” But this was no April Fool's joke. Spain had retaken its former colony Santo Domingo not two weeks prior, and (in a very diplomatic manner, of course) spit in the U.S.'s face by further increasing their Cuban garrison to 25,000 men. France was getting somewhat fidgety over Haiti and their other colonies in the New World. Keep in mind that the U.S. had issued the Monroe Doctrine not quite three decades prior. Spain and France's actions, however ridiculous, were clearly in violation thereof. “Our domestic dissensions are producing their natural fruit,” wrote The New York Times on March 30, 1861. “The terror of the American name is gone, and the Powers of the Old World are flocking to the feast from which the scream of our eagle had hitherto scared them. We are just beginning to suffer the penalties of being a weak and despised Power.” In short, the U.S. had become something of a laughing-stock, if the reporters are to be believed.

				In his inaugural address, Abraham Lincoln said: 
				<blockquote>
					The power confided in me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property belonging to the government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion&mdash;no using force against, ar among the people anywhere.
				</blockquote>
				Does this translate as "You pay the tariffs, and I won't invade"?
				It gets worse.
				<blockquote>
					I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the United States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.
				</blockquote>
				It gets worse. That was just his inaugural speech. In a 1858 debate, he said these fateful words:
				<blockquote>
					I will say then that I am not, nor have ever been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races&mdash;that I am not, nor have ever been, in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold public office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe forever forbids the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And in as much as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.
				</blockquote>
				His fate to be condemned by history as the horrible, sorry excuse for a rather tall piece of boiled cabbage he was should have been sealed there ond then. But...
				It gets worse. Much, much worse.
				Lincoln admitted that he had manipulated events at Fort Sumter so that the South fired the first shot&mdash;making the North the "good guys". his wouldn't be hard to do. The South military culture (involving a significantly less tactical, more aggressive, frontal military strategems) was quite conducive to provocation. The North military culture was more focused on waiting for an opportune inroad&mdash;and taking it. In the meantime, they kept low. This is exactly what happened at Fort Sumter. The general in charge of the Union's precious tariff collection point essentially kept his head down while he waited for the ship scheduled to resupply the Fort. When a fully armed warship sailed into view, the Southern troops were more than a little ticked off. They take Fort Sumter, the general surrenders, you start a war, and Bob's your uncle. The Americas magically carve themselves up, ripe for British picking.

				The puppeteer-esque nature of the entire affair prompted a few of the more paranoid to start wracking their brains for possible explanations. There is now a conspiracy theory that the battalion ship sent to resupply Fort Sumter was in fact sent from the British navy. On top of this, Lincoln was in on the British plot to retake their land in the Americas in this grand plot, sent to terminate Abraham Lincoln. John Wilkes Booth was in fact an operative  Accounts vary as to the motive, but it certainly does explain a lot. Lincoln's total resignation to his assassination suddenly has reason. The crude joke that was the final words in Lincoln's perfect ears provides the perfect twist of irony to complete the paranoia. All we really know is that Lincoln was a total scumbag and does not deserve the infallible position he seems to have cemented himself in.
