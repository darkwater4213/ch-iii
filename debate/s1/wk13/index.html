				If you ask someone on the street what the cause of the American Civil War was, they'll likely say something about freeing the slaves or keeping the Union whole. <i>They're wrong</i>. If you were to ask the same people <i>who</i> caused it, they'll almost definitely say the South, when they fired on Fort Sumter. But this time, they're not just wrong&mdash;they're deceived. Hoodwinked. Snookered. Had the cotton pulled over their eyes. <!-- Thanks, Eli! --> It is true that the South fired first, but they weren't the provokers, and certainly were not the cause. As with most conflicts, it all boils down to politics. But it wasn't the politics of the South and the North&mdash;it was the East and the West.

				On April 1st, 1861, Secretary of State William Seward wrote a memo requesting action against "European intervention". The Civil War had not yet begun. “I would at once demand explanations from France and Spain categorically,” Seward wrote. “I would demand explanations from Great Britain and Russia&hellip; And if satisfactory explanations are not received from Spain and France, I would convene Congress and declare war against them.” But this was no April Fool's joke. Spain had retaken its former colony Santo Domingo not two weeks prior, and (in a very diplomatic manner, of course) spit in the U.S.'s face by further increasing their Cuban garrison to 25,000 men. France was getting somewhat fidgety over Haiti and their other colonies in the New World. Keep in mind that the U.S. had issued the Monroe Doctrine not quite three decades prior. Spain and France's actions, however ridiculous, were clearly in violation thereof. “Our domestic dissensions are producing their natural fruit,” wrote The New York Times on March 30, 1861. “The terror of the American name is gone, and the Powers of the Old World are flocking to the feast from which the scream of our eagle had hitherto scared them. We are just beginning to suffer the penalties of being a weak and despised Power.” In short, the U.S. had become something of a laughing-stock, if the reporters are to be believed.
