                During the early 1800s -- a time of economic tensions between the U.S. and Europe; especially with Spain and France <cite id="cite11">(Schweikart, 196)</cite> -- a large diplomatic brouhaha <!-- maybe change this phrase --> took place. In 1815, there were only two independent American nations: The U.S. and Haiti. But within half a decade, national opinions in South America had somewhat changed -- Enough for the citizens to start fighting for independence. John Quincy Adams, the Secretary of State, attempted to keep the U.S. out of it while he was still negotiating the Adams-On&iacute;s treaty to acquire Florida from Spain. In 1823, France invaded Spain to "prop up King Ferdinand VII, who had been forced to accept a liberal constitution". <cite id="cite12">(ThoughtCo.)</cite> Britain did not appreciate this for the simple reason that France was once an enemy and therefore could not be allowed to lay claim to geostrategic footholds in the New World "if for no other reason than traditional balance-of-power politics". A U.S.-Britain alliance to prevent further Imperialist actions on the part of Spain and France was suggested. Adams balked at the idea, noting that an alliance with Britain could very well prevent the U.S from expanding their territory. He also had personal reasons: he did not want to revive old accusations of "Anglophilia". <cite id="cite13">(Schweikart, 206)</cite>. Monroe thus dictated his famous Doctrine.

                Naturally, no history would be complete without a little inaccuracy. John Adams was in fact the original author of the Monroe Doctrine <cite id="cite21">(History.com)</cite>. It first appeared in James Monroe's annual address to Congress -- the 1800s equivalent of the State of the Union Address <cite id="cite22">(Archives.gov)</cite>. It was buried under a veritable mountain of assorted statements about foreign nations, including decrying the economic and political states of multiple colonizing nations, especially Spain and France <cite id="cite23">(NARA)</cite>. The needle in this particular haystack had three main points. Europe was to stay out of the Americas in general. In return, the Americas, especially the United States, stay out of Europe. Furthermore, any so-called "puppet monarchs" would not be tolerated by the Western Hemisphere any longer -- which had far greater implications than initially thought.
                <blockquote>
                    ...the American Continents, by the free condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers...<br/>
                    It is still the true policy of the United States to leave the parties <i>[Europe]</i> to themselves, in hope that other powers will pursue the same course...
                </blockquote>

                Europe did not largely take too kindly to this. Or rather, they wouldn't have -- had most even known about it. Monroe either very cleverly or quite ignorantly hid his policy away in a deluge of criticisms of the state of European nations in general, wrapped in a long-winded speech, covered in poop and circumstance entirely. <!-- i promise thats a typo lol... or at least it was ;P --> <!-- On the other hand, perhaps that is exactly where one ought to look for foreign policy... --> At any rate, it just sat there, doing a grand total of nothing much for quite a while. The U.S. did not invoke the Monroe Doctrine during the 1833 British takeover of the Falklands, nor during the 1845 Argentina conflict. After all, the U.S. was not yet a proper world power, and hardly had the resources or military strength to back up threats of retaliation against national security issues. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Pres. James K. Polk warned Britain and Spain against colonizing Oregon and California, as well as the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula in Mexico that same year, in the spirit of the rather presumptuous-sounding Manifest Destiny.
                <blockquote>
                    The nations of America are equally sovereign and independent with those of Europe. They possess the same rights, independent of all foreign interposition, to make war, to conclude peace, and to regulate their internal affairs. The people of the United States cannot, therefore, view with indifference the attempts of European powers to interfere with the independent action of the nations of this continent.

                Part of this expansionist movement was a revived interest in their neighbors. In 1867, the U.S> supplied significant diplomatic and military support to Benito Ju&aacute;rez in his overthrowing of the French puppet monarch in Mexico. <cite id="cite51">(History.com)</cite>. Emperor Maximilian was quickly dethroned.

                The U.S. really came into play in international politics as a world power in the 1870s, which also marked a big change in how the government treated foreign nations -- and threats. For instance, Theodore Roosevelt <!-- God rest his soul! --> famously appended the so-called "Big Stick" policy to the Monroe Doctrine as a sort of a corollary. He used it to justify intervening in Latin America countries to stop European businessmen and assorted persons of varying distastefulness from forcibly collecting debts: "Chronic wrongdoing... may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation". He continued: "In the western Hemisphere the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power." His words, however well-meaning, were then used to intervene militarily in foreign affairs in the Caribbean, Central America, Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic.

                President John F. Kennedy <!-- Insert "never gets old" joke here -->  also invoked the Monroe Doctrine curing the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. The USSR decided to start building missile sites, the U.S. told them to clear out or face the wrath of a very big stick. With the help of the newly-formed Organization of American States, or OAS, the U.S. formed an aerial and naval quarantine area around Cuba and froze the Russians out. To show their gratitude, the U.S. also dismantled a few obsolete international military outposts of their own in Turkey <cite id="cite63">(Archives.gov)</cite>.
                <!-- At this point, the U.S. has thoroughly asserted its position in terms of colonization of the Americas. All that is left is to... Oh, dear. Here comes the OAS. -->

                The final consequence of the Monroe Doctrine was the formation of the OAS -- Organization of American States -- the Doctrine's final, dying wish, if you will. The OAS is largely similar to OPEC in function, but significantly less powerful -- and less prevalent in the news. Part of this is because the OAS is largely present as a loose governmental watchdog, ensuring that American nations maintained some semblance of democratic republicanism in the proper application of the ethical and philosophical principles that the Americans were originally founded on.
