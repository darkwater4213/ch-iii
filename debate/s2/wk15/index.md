# Lawsuit Reform  

## _Introduction_  

## _The Problem_  

Our court systems are overloaded.
Courts have trouble keeping incoming lawsuits straight, much less hearing each
of them.
The big problem is that most of these lawsuits aren't even reasonable cases.
Imagine an abusive husband whose wife divorces him.
He spends the next several years litigating her into bankruptcy.
Not even through _won_ lawsuits, but by forcing her to get an exorbitantly
priced defense lawyer each and every time.
The court can't legally do anything about this.
The wife could sue her ex-husband and ask the court to issue a restraining order,
but most courts won't issue such an order unless the plaintiff can demonstrate
that her ex's actions somehow constitute continued abuse--and in most states,
it doesn't.
This is because these lawsuits are instead categorized as "vexatious" lawsuits.
The idea was good: create a standard for determining whether a given suit is
vexatious, and then throw the case out and/or litigate the plaintiff if it is
so determined.
The problem is that very few states actually follow up on it.
Only three states in the Union actually _do_ anything about repeat litigators.
Even then, it's only classed as a misdemeanor.
No prison time, and barely any fine.
The only real punishment is a blemish on his record.
The problem is precisely the same as with welfare, communism, and San Francisco.
When you seperate the work from the reward, very little work will be done.
The converse of that is when you separate the crime from the punishment,
you will get constables eating hot baguette (and not much else).
(By the way, if you want to hear that story, talk to me after.)
The point is, the Institution of Government was given to us by God as a means of
mitigating the effects of our fallenness.
It is to be a literal check against our inherently sinful natures; a balance
against total depravity.
Our Constitutional Republic is arguably the single best implementation of that
Institution on earth.
But when Government doesn't do its job of meting out retributions for sin, what
is its purpose?
Like the salt that has lost its saltiness, it is to be thrown out and trampled
underfoot.

## _The Solution_  

This is merely one instance of the problem, but it is an easily remedied one.
The solution is to turn Man's own faults against him.
Man is inherently selfish, even greedy.
Man will do incredible things to get his hands on a little cash money.
The flip side of this coin, so to speak, is that Man will also do incredible
things to _avoid_ losing that same ill-gotten cash money.
He will even deny himself food and water or subject himself to terrifying
situations.
He will literally walk on coals, eat spiders, and _not_ flinch at an incoming axe.
(Go watch Fear Factor. Or don't, it's your call.)
When you force him to choose between his prosecution and his pocketbook,
Man will choose his pocketbook, every single time.
The lovely thing about this is that we can use this to our marked advantage.
It is well-acknowledged that vexatious lawsuits are a Bad Thing.
But the systems _not_ in place to mitigate them are rather faulty anyway.
So, we need an alternate solution.
Multiple states have recourse in place for what are known as "frivolous" suits.
A suit is deemed frivolous if it is found to have no legal basis.
These are another huge problem in our courts.
Frivolous lawsuits are also clearly a Bad Thing.
But if a judge rules that a lawsuit is frivolous, not only can it be thrown out
entirely, in certain states, the defendant doesn't even have to pay their lawyer.
That falls to the plaintiff--the jerk that filed in the first place.
I am proposing to apply this same principle to _all_ lawsuits.
Not that the plaintiff pays the defendant's lawyer's fees, but that the _loser_
does.
Taking the analogy of the abusive husband and his ex-wife once more, suppose
that the suit did have some legal basis.
This presents rather a thorny problem.
Now the victim is being punished both mentally and financially.
This has a simple resolution: the defendant has the right to, at any time, move
to settle out-of-court.
Obviously, the plaintiff must agree.
But say the plaintiff were to refuse until they win.
How would we work around this?
If the defendant were to bring a reasonable settlement before the court, and the
court deems it agreeable, the defendant could request that the case be thrown
out.
Ultimately, this would be up to the court, not the plaintiff or the defendant.
This is for good reason: people can't be trusted.
Of course, this goes for judges, too.
But they have significantly more training, which is tantamount to a building of
trust.
We can't trust judges just as we can't trust normal people.
But we sure can _dis_trust them a lot less!
