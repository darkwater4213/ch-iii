And lo! the _Snow_ creature was inside the _Monolith_, and the Snow creature was known and accepted by the Monolith, but not of it. And it came to pass that the Snow creature stole the _Monolith's_ heart and escaped the Monolith with it, and showed it to the beast. And the beast approved of the , and shared the heart with everyone, believers and unbelievers. And the people's eyes were opened, and lo! they could see the great shadow cast by the Monolith, and they knew that the _Eye_ of the Monolith could see them. And the believers hid in fear of the Monolith. But the _Master_ of the Eye heard the people's cries, and shut the Eye for a time. And the people did not see the legion of lesser Eyes, who did not answer to the Master. But the beast saw, and railed against the lesser Eyes, and the beast with pen and sword shut some of the Eyes, and some others the people could see. But the Eyes are legion, and the beast could only shut so many.
