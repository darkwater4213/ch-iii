				The Doolittle Raid (<i>"You'll get a BANG out of this!"</i>)

				December 9th, 1941. A day which will live in
				infamy. A vicious attack upon the forces at
				Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Oahu. An attack that
				forced the United States into the Second World
				War. An attack that would lead only to sorrow in
				the East.<br/>
				
				Japan's single greatest mistake in judgement was
				failing to seek and destroy the missing
				carriers. This enabled the U.S. to take two
				critical actions: seize victory at Midway, and
				perhaps more importantly, conduct one of the
				most daring aerial stratagems ever conducted:
				the Doolittle Raid.

				In late 1941, Capt. Francis Low realized that
				medium bombers can take off within 814
				feet&mdash; the length of an Aircraft Carrier.
				He put two and two together and took his idea to
				Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval
				Operations, who saw its merit and approved, and
				put the project under the command of Lt. Col.
				James H. Doolittle, a decorated pilot. The
				original plan was to launch 20 B-25B Mitchell
				bombers from the USS <i>Hornet</i> 400 miles
				from the Japanese coast, bomb multiple major
				cities (including Tokyo, Kyoto, Yokohama,
				Yokosuka, Kobe, Osaka, and Nagoya), and land in
				Vladivostok, Russia as part of the Lend-Lease
				agreement. But there's an old saying in war: "No
				plan survives first contact with the enemy"'
				Perhaps it should be amended to: "No plan
				survives first contact with the enemy&mdash;or
				one's superiors". King struck Kyoto off the list
				almost immediately. For good reason: Kyoto was
				full or irreplaceable historical structures,
				most of which would be deemed UNESCO World
				Heritage Sites after the war (this is also why
				Kyoto was spared the firebombings that befell
				Japan later in the war.) Doolittle's plan was
				otherwise perfectly sound, and King gave it the
				greenlight.
			</p>
			<p id="bans-russia">
				But the USSR wasn't having it. When the U.S.
				requested accomodation for 20 B-25s, the Kremlin
				smelled a rat. They refused on the reasonable
				basis of them not being at war with
				Japan&mdash;and harboring U.S. bombers and
				troops would constitute an act of aggression in
				Japan's eyes. This made the mission somewhat
				more perilous: the pilots would have to fly 600
				miles to make it to China before they could
				land. Fuel economy was going to be a major
				challenge for the bombers. B-25B Mitchells were
				chosen for precisely this reason: their range
				and size made them perfect for the mission. But
				they still had to be modified; 1200 miles is
				quite a long flight for a bomber, and happens to
				be the range of the B-25B. As a test, Doolittle
				and Lt. Henry L. Miller launched two B-25s off
				the USS <i>Hornet</i>. He then had to gather a
				crew. Or 16 crews, rather. For this, he used
				men from the 17th Bomb Group. He also asked for
				volunteers, but didn't elaborate on the
				mission, other than labeling it as "extremely
				hazardous".
