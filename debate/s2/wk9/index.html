				The Doolittle Raid (<i>"You'll get a BANG out of this!"</i>)

			<p id="intro">
				December 9th, 1941. A day which will live in infamy. A vicious attack upon the forces at Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Oahu. An attack that forced the United States into the Second World War. An attack that would lead only to sorrow in the East.<br/>
				Japan's single greatest mistake in judgement was failing to seek and destroy the missing carriers. This enabled the U.S. to take two critical actions: seize victory at Midway, and perhaps more importantly, conduct one of the most daring aerial stratagems ever conducted: the Doolittle Raid.
			</p>
			<p id="first-contact">
				In late 1941, Capt. Francis Low realized that medium bombers can take off within 814 feet&mdash; the length of an Aircraft Carrier. He put two and two together and took his idea to Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations, who saw its merit and approved, and put the project under the command of Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle, a decorated pilot. The original plan was to launch 20 B-25B Mitchell bombers from the <i>USS Hornet</i> 400 miles from the Japanese coast, bomb multiple major cities (including Tokyo, Kyoto, Yokohama, Yokosuka, Kobe, Osaka, and Nagoya), and land in Vladivostok, Russia as part of the Lend-Lease agreement. But there's an old saying in war: "No plan survives first contact with the enemy"'. Perhaps it should be amended to: "No plan survives first contact with the enemy&mdash;or one's superiors". King struck Kyoto off the list almost immediately. For good reason: Kyoto was full or irreplaceable historical structures, most of which would be deemed UNESCO World Heritage Sites after the war (this is also why Kyoto was spared the firebombings that befell Japan later in the war.) Doolittle's plan was otherwise perfectly sound, and King gave it the green light.

				But the USSR wasn't having it. When the U.S. requested accommodation for 20 B-25s, the Kremlin smelled a rat. They refused on the reasonable basis of them not being at war with Japan&mdash;and harboring U.S. bombers and troops would constitute an act of aggression in Japan's eyes. This made the mission somewhat more perilous: the pilots would have to fly 600 miles to make it to China before they could land. Fuel economy was going to be a major challenge for the bombers. B-25B Mitchells were chosen for precisely this reason: their range and size made them perfect for the mission. But they still had to be modified; 1200 miles is quite a long flight for a bomber, and happens to be the range of the B-25B. As a test, Doolittle and Lt. Henry L. Miller launched two B-25s off the <i>USS Hornet</i>. He then had to gather a crew. Or 16 crews, rather. For this, he used men from the 17th Bombardment Group. He also asked for volunteers, but didn't elaborate on the mission, other than labeling it as "extremely hazardous".

				The volunteers were then taken to Eglin Field, Florida, to commence their training. This consisted of multiple exercises, primarily taking off. Lt. Henry L. Miller also assisted with takeoff training. The Raiders also practiced low-level bombing, aerial gunnery (essentially dogfights but less fun), cross-country and night flying, radio-less navigating, and other such skills. They completed in March 1942, and boarded the <i>Hornet</i> in San Francisco shortly thereafter.

				But there was still much work to be done&mdash;not on the people, but on the planes. A standard B-25 has a range of about 1,200 miles, but the Raiders needed at least 1,400, assuming everything went well (and in war, nothing ever goes well). So, they flew each of the 24 bombers to McClellan Field and modified each of them by stripping out anything not deemed absolutely necessary, including the rear gun, which was replaced with a broomstick handle to wald off any would-be hostile tailgaters. As it turned out, that ploy worked perfectly. Other changes were made: the fuel tank size was doubled; there would be ne refueling on this trip. The Norden bombsight (a closely guarded Allied secret) was also removed. Not because of weight, but because of it ineffectiveness at high altitudes. It was replaced with a custom bombsight constructed out of 20-cent parts by the Eglin Field metal shops, hence its nickname, "The 20-cent bombsight". Finally, additional deicing equipment was added to mitigate the seaspray and cold weather (which would otherwise cause major problems on such a long flight).

				On March 29th, 15 planes were selected (with one extra in reserve) were flown to Alameda Naval Air Station and landed on the <i>USS Hornet</i>. The <i>Hornet</i> sailed from Alameda and loaded 72 Officers and 64 Enlisted. The <i>Hornet's</i> captain, Marc A. Mitscher, didn't like the idea of leaving port at night due to his inexperienced crew, so the <i>Hornet</i> left harbor on April 2, 1942 in broad daylight. She met up with Admiral William F. Halsey's Task Force 18 at Hawaii, which would provide air cover for the Raiders. In total, the raid consisted of two carriers, eight destroyers, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and two oilers. On April 17th, the fleet refueled for the last time. Radio silence was to be maintained from this point forward. The oilers and destroyers then withdrew back east. No sens in putting them in danger, too. The force was now deep in Japanese territory. They were spotted April 18th.

			<p id="picket-line">
				What the Task Force had not expected was the long line of picket boats (repurposed fishing vessels, fitted with radios and guns) 650 miles from Japan's coast. They were expecting to launch 400 miles from the coast, giving the planes plenty of buffer. This simply was not to be. The captain of the <i>Hornet</i> refused to jeopardize the carrier.
