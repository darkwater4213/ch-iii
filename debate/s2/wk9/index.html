				December 9th, 1941. A day which will live in infamy. A vicious attack upon the forces at Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Oahu. An attack that forced the United States into the Second World War. An attack that would lead only to sorrow in the East.<br/>
				Japan's single greatest mistake in judgement was failing to seek and destroy the missing carriers. This enabled the U.S. to take two critical actions: seize victory at Midway, and perhaps more importantly, conduct one of the most daring aerial stratagems ever conducted: the Doolittle Raid.
			</p>
			<p id="first-contact">
				In late 1941, Capt. Francis Low realized that medium bombers can take off within the approximate length of an aircraft carrier. He put two and two together and took his idea to Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations, who saw its merit and approved, and put the project under the command of Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle, a decorated pilot. The original plan was to launch 20 B-25B Mitchell bombers from the <i>USS Hornet</i> 400 miles from the Japanese coast, bomb multiple major cities (including Tokyo, Kyoto, Yokohama, Yokosuka, Kobe, Osaka, and Nagoya), and land in Vladivostok, Russia as part of the Lend-Lease agreement. But there's an old saying in war: "No plan survives first contact with the enemy". Perhaps it should be amended to: "No plan survives first contact with the enemy&mdash;or one's superiors". King struck Kyoto off the list almost immediately. For good reason: Kyoto was full of irreplaceable historical structures, most of which would be deemed UNESCO World Heritage Sites after the war (this is also why Kyoto was spared the firebombings that befell Japan later in the war.) Doolittle's plan was otherwise perfectly sound, and King gave it the green light.

			<p id="bans-russia">
				But the Russians weren't having it. When the U.S. requested accommodation for 20 B-25s, the Kremlin smelled a rat. They refused on the reasonable basis of them not being at war with Japan. Harboring U.S. bombers and troops would constitute an act of aggression in Japan's eyes. This made the mission somewhat more perilous: the pilots would have to fly 600 miles to make it to China before they could land. Fuel economy was going to be a major challenge for the bombers. B-25B Mitchells were chosen for precisely this reason: their range and size made them perfect for the mission. But they still had to be modified; 1200 miles is a long flight for a bomber, but it happens to be the range of the B-25B. As a test, Doolittle and Lt. Henry L. Miller successfully launched two B-25s off the flight deck of the <i>USS Hornet</i>. He then had to gather enough crews fo. For this, he used men from the 17th Bombardment Group. He asked for volunteers, but did not elaborate on the mission, beyond labeling it as "extremely hazardous".
			</p>
			<p id="training">
				The volunteers were then taken to Eglin Field, Florida, to commence their training. This consisted of multiple exercises, primarily taking off. Lt. Henry L. Miller also assisted with takeoff training. The Raiders also practiced low-level bombing, aerial gunnery, <!-- (essentially dogfights but less fun) --> cross-country and night flying, radio-less navigating, and other such skills. They completed in March 1942, and boarded the <i>Hornet</i> in San Francisco shortly thereafter.
			</p>
			<p id="mods">
				But there was still much work to be done&mdash;not on the people, but on the planes. A standard B-25 has a range of about 1,200 miles, but the Raiders needed at least 1,400, assuming everything went well, but in war, nothing ever goes well. So, they flew each of the 24 bombers to McClellan Field and modified each of them by stripping out anything not deemed absolutely necessary, including the rear gun, which was replaced with a broomstick handle to scare off any would-be hostile tailgaters. As it turned out, that ploy worked perfectly. Other changes were made: the fuel tank size was doubled&mdash;there would be no refueling on this trip. The Norden bombsight (a closely guarded Allied secret) was also removed from each bomber, Not because of weight, but because of it ineffectiveness at low altitudes. It was replaced with a custom bombsight constructed out of 20-cent parts by the Eglin Field metal shops, hence its nickname, "The 20-cent bombsight". Finally, additional deicing equipment was added to mitigate the seaspray and cold weather, which would otherwise cause major problems on such a long flight.

				On March 29th, 15 planes were selected, with one more as reserve, and were then flown to Alameda Naval Air Station and were loaded on the <i>USS Hornet</i>. The <i>Hornet</i> sailed from Alameda and loaded 72 Officers and 64 Enlisted. The <i>Hornet's</i> captain, Marc A. Mitscher, did not like the idea of leaving port at night due to his inexperienced crew, so the <i>Hornet</i> left harbor on April 2, 1942 in broad daylight. She met up with Admiral William F. Halsey's Task Force 18 at Hawaii, which would provide air cover for the Raiders. In total, the raid consisted of two carriers, eight destroyers, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and two oilers. On April 17th, the fleet refueled for the last time. Radio silence was to be maintained from this point forward. The oilers and destroyers then withdrew. The force was now deep in Japanese territory. They were spotted April 18th.
			</p>
			<p id="picket-line">
				What the Task Force had not expected was the long line of picket boats (repurposed fishing vessels, fitted with radios and guns) 650 miles from Japan's coast. They were expecting to launch 400 miles from the coast, giving the planes plenty of buffer. This simply was not to be. Admiral Halsey refused to jeopardize the carriers, and dispatched the following message to the <i>Hornet</i>:<br/>
				<blockquote>
					LAUNCH PLANES. TO COL. DOOLITTLE AND GALLANT CREW, GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS YOU.
				</blockquote>
				The Doolittle raid launched 820 miles from Japan, twice as far as they ought to have been.

				Instructions: Avoid nonmilitary targets. Avoid the Imperial Palace at all costs. Even if landing China proved to be impossible, diverting to Russia was out. Crews were to continue to China as far as possible. If ditching the planes became necessary, the crews were to continue in rubber boats. All planes were in the air within an hour, assisted by a 25 mile-per-hour tailwind. Approach was uneventful, but an hour in, the Raiders came across what they surmised to be a camouflaged light cruiser and a large aircraft. They actively avoided all water- and aircraft from then on. No sense in compromising the mission. Landfall was made just north of Cape Inub&omacr;, reasonably on-course. As the other groups headed off for their targets, Doolittle's group approached Tokyo from the north. The bombers flew as low as possible. Ten miles from Tokyo, three groups of three fighters were spotted, but they did not engage. The raiders climbed to 1,200 feet as they approached, dropped the bombs, and dropped back to treetop level. The ensuing Japanese antiaircraft fire was "intense but inaccurate", and no personnel or aircraft were lost. Approximately 14 tons of ordinance was dropped, though the damage was primarily psychological rather than physical.

				Bad weather followed the Raiders over the East China Sea. They climbed to 6,000 feet in attempt to climb out of it, with some success. The consequences of this was a complete lack of visibility&mdash;the pilots were relying solely on instruments. Doolittle (the only one to keep his radio) attempted to contact Chuchow, but to no avail. Fuel was running low, so he glanced at the clock, 9:20 pm&mdash;exactly 13 hours since they took off&mdash;and ordered his crew to bail out. Doolittle's crew landed safely in Allied China and immediately made contact with Gen. Ho Yang Ling (He Yangling) in west Chekiang (Zhekiang) Province and asked him to keep a lookout for downed planes and rubber boats. By April 20, four more crews and their planes had been found. Doolittle wired the following message from the embassy in Chungking (Chongqing):
				<blockquote>
					Tokyo successfully bombed. Due to bad weather on China coast, believe all airplanes wrecked. Five crews found safe in China so far.
				</blockquote>
				There were only three fatalities during the landings and bail-outs: Corp. Leland Faktor, Sgt. William Dieter, and Corp. Donald Fitzmaurice. All but three of the 16 crews made it to Chungking. Capt. Edwin J. York was short on fuel and was forced to land in Russia, near Vladivostok. He and his crew were interned by the Soviets for over a year before they managed to "escape" into British-occupied Iran. This escape was something of a farce however: it was, in actuality, a carefully-planned NKVD operation staged to look like an escape, to repatriate the Americans while still retaining plausible deniability with the Japanese. The other two crews were captured by the Japanese, one on the coast and the other near Lake Poyang. The Japanese refused the Chinese' repeated attempts to buy the crews' freedom. Four raiders were imprisoned until the end of the war. Lieut. Robert J. Meder died of dysentery in 1943, and three others, Lieut. Dean Hallmark, Lieut. William Farrow, and Sgt. Harold Spatz, were put on a show trial by the Japanese army, then executed by beheading in October 1942.

			<p id="reprisal">
				But the horror did not end there. The Japanese army carried out a reprisal campaign during the summer of 1942. Within days of the raid, Japan had already formulated a plan to eliminate the airfields and punish those who had assisted the Americans. The Second Sino-Japanese War had reached something of a stalemate, but Doolittle did quite a bit to shake things up. In early June of that same year, the Japanese launched a brutal offensive, so terrible and horrifying in its violence that it rivaled the Nanking massacre, often referred to as the "Rape of Nanking", due to the systematic atrocities the Japanese committed against the Chinese populace. Once the Japanese army had concluded its three-month reprisal, Japan's infamous Biological warfare department, Unit 731, moved in and seeded the area with Typhoid, Cholera, Dysentery, and other such diseases, ravaging the remaining Chinese.

				There is now a memorial to the victims of the campaign in Chuchow. The Doolittle Raiders were each awarded Distinguished Flying Crosses. Doolittle himself was awarded the Medal of Honor. In 2014, all 80 members of the Doolittle Raiders were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.
