					[Ephesians 5:22]
				</span>
				<span id="narratio">
					Lucentio, Hortensio, and Gremio each wish to marry Bianca, Baptista's younger daughter. Unfortunately for each of them, there are two problems with such an arrangement: the other suitors and Bianca's older sister, Kate. The first problem is easily remedied by a gentlemen's arrangement of may-the-best-suitor-win-and-the-losers-are-the-best-men-in-more-ways-than-one. This is not so easily remedied. In-laws are already generally a nuisance, <!-- Not really but wth it's funny--> but this one is particularly horrible. Baptista Minola, Bianca and Kate's father, demands that Kate be married before Bianca can be. <span id="agreement">This poses something of a problem, due to the fact that Kate is an infamous shrew&mdash;a sharp wit and an even sharper tongue.</span> Petruchio offers to marry Kate for her dowry on the condition that he has to tame the shrew, as it were.
				</span>
				<span id="disagreement">
					Unfortunately for Kate, his methods are somewhat unorthodox&mdash;including endless banter, complaining to Kate about the food his own servants made (and insisting she not eat it), starving her, and finally demanding that the sun is the moon is the sun is a candle, respectively.
				</span>
				<span id="distribution">
					<!--
						Today, I will prove to you that Petruchio's treatment of Kate was wholly justified
					-->
				</span>
				<span id="distribution">
					<!--
						for these three crappy reasons: Lucentio and Hortensio want to marry Bianca, Kate's attitude is a problem, and the results are quite beneficial.
					-->
				</span>
			</p>
			<p id="body-1">
				Baptista's demands were not unfounded. Kate was a known shrew. His reasoning went something like this: If Bianca gats married before Kate does, I'll be stuck with her forever&mdash;and it'll be the death of me! Petruchio offers to remedy the problem by marrying Kate, and get her out of Baptista's thinning hair. HE agrees to do this on the condition (his own condition, not Baptista's, strangely enough) that he must teach her to be a functional human being, humble to her husband and respectful to all. In short, Bianca (and her suitors) are depending upon him to marry Kate and to (for lack of a better term) to tame her.
			</p>
			<p id="refutation-1">
				Unfortunately, his methods are, as mentioned decidedly unorthodox. This results (for Kate) in multiple minor disasters&mdash;and some significantly larger disasters. Grumio, one of Petruchio's servants, relates to the household staff a long and wretched story of how when their horses fell down on the way home, Petruchio had a proper gentleman's tantrum, and instead of helping his new wife out from under her horse, instead bawled at (and beat) Grumio soundly for letting the horses fall. He was then commanded to run the rest of the way home to start a fire, "for... winter tames man, woman and beast." <cite>(IV.i 21)</cite>. Curtis is (being Curtis, and none other) no help at all, and refuses to start a fire until Grumio relates his entire sob story. But that's not the worst bit. During the wedding earlier, Petruchio was on his worst behavior&mdash;whining at the officiant, calling for a goblet of wine then splashing it all over said officiant, coming in the clothing of a dirty 12-year-old with no fashion sense, and generally acting like a child raised by Kobolds. Kate (and certain persons with blue hair) would object to such treatment. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately) for such persons, Petruchio's aim in such actions is merely to show Kate's erroneous ways for what they are. Petruchio did not do anything Kate herself was not already guilty of. Such pain is merely part of the process.

			<p id="refutation-2">
				But such persons as might object to Petruchio's behavior would also maintain that Petruchio is being oppressive, perhaps even masculine to the point of toxicity. And one most certainly does not want to promote the patriarchy. After all, marital slavery or submission isn't in a woman's job description&mdash;and men get all the credit for everything anyways. Unfortunately for such arguments is the fact that the insinuation that the Bible is somehow patriarchal or anti-women (the basis for that entire argument) is entirely unfounded and is in fact materially false. Ephesians 5:22, the oft-cited verse detailing the Bible's "patriarchy", continues thus: "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loves the Church". Paul then goes on to relate how this extends to personal sacrifice&mdash;husbands are to even lay down their life for their wives.
			</p>
			<p id="body-3">
				Perhaps this makes the Bible anti-men. But what it really does is it justifies Petruchio's behavior. He explicitly stated <cite>(II.i 177-189)</cite> that his goal is to make her "conformable to other household Kates" (a play on words, referring to ?ref) <cite>()</cite> He was carrying out his God-given duty to love his wife and to build her up rather than to break her down.
