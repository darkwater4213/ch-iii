Practice

Use the worksheet below to practice gathering information to determine whether an action is just. You will gather information once imaging yourself as the prosecution and once imaging yourself as the defense.

Express the issue in the form “Whether X should be admonished for Y.”





Record your answers for the following questions in the ANI chart.

Prosecutor
Assume the role of the prosecution and gather information for the A column, using the common and special topics. You are asking questions to find every reason the defendant should be admonished. (Write negative items as they come up in your prosecution work.)
Gather additional information for the A column using the special topic of Justice by answering the following questions.

Justice: Why might the action be unjust?
In what way was the action inappropriate (if any)?
In what way was the action wrong (if any)?
In what way was the action unfair (if any)?
What rules were broken?
If any were, who made the rules?

Add this information to the Affirmative column of your ANI.

Sort the A column.

List the best an sit, quid sit, and quale sit argument.

Write your approved Issue here:
First, write a minimum of 30 items in the Affirmative column. (Please NUMBER YOUR LISTS!) You may write items in Negative and Interesting as you go, but you are focusing on Prosecution first. (In the end, you should have at least 30 items in all three columns.)
Sort the Affirmative column.
Follow instructions below the ANI.
Affirmative
(should be admonished):
Negative
(should not be admonished):
Interesting/Indeterminate:



Sort the A column.

List the best an sit, quid sit, and quale sit argument.

DEFENSE
ASSUME THE ROLE OF THE DEFENSE
Change hats. To defend your defendant, gather information for the N column, using the common and special topics (an sit/evidence, quid sit/laws, and quale sit/motives). Look for anything that would prevent your defendant from being admonished or punished.

Gather additional information for the N column using the special topic of Justice by answering the following questions.

Justice: Why might the action be just?
In what way was the action appropriate (if any)?
In what way was the action right (if any)?
In what way was the action fair (if any)?
What rules were kept?
If any were, who made the rules?

Add this information to the Negative column of your ANI.

Sort the N column.

Determine which prosecution (Affirmative) argument from your three above (an sit, quid sit, and quale sit) is the weakest.

Write it here.

Identify whether it is: an sit, quid sit, and quale sit.

For the weakest, identify the three best defense arguments against it.

(For example, if their weakness is an sit, then your defense will seek to discredit their physical evidence and the credibility of their witnesses.)

List the best three defense arguments that demonstrate the prosecution's weakness:

Choose a thesis. If the defense’s case adequately exposes the weakness in the prosecution’s case, then you will defend. If it does not, you will prosecute.

Practice


There are two kinds of bias: for and against. In this exercise, you identify how a character is biased for or against the defendant, the action, and the victim.

Restate your issue in the form “Whether X should be admonished for Y.”



Identify the following:
The defendant (X)
 -
 The action (Y)
 -
 The effects of the issue
 -
 -
 The victim(s) (people who suffered as a result of the action - could be the defendant!)
  -
  Fill out the three charts below. Here’s how.
  In the first/left column of the chart below, list four characters from the story.
  In the second column, state whether the characters are inclined to favor or oppose the defendant/action/victim.
  In the last/right column, state how each character demonstrates his bias: what  did he do or say that showed you his inclination.
