                    Marcus Gaius Brutus (?check) was in a predicament (?fix). His best friend, Marcus Julius Caesar, had risen to power. He had assumed command of the Roman legions in Gaul and the surrounding areas, leading them to massive strategic victories against the various tribes in those areas. He then returned to Rome in Triumph. <!-- Literally -- a Triumph was a formal victorious military procession, usually culminating in the beheading or other execution of the conquered king. Rather grisly, if I do say so. There are some interesting historical points here, including the massive embarrassment the third and fourth Triumphs Shakespeare is here referring to -- also likely where he drew some inspiration from. --> Cassius roped Brutus into a conspiracy to bring Caesar low. To bring him to his knees -- to put an end to his tyranny, once and for all. Brutus assented. After all, it was expected that the Senate was to offer Caesar the royal crown, to make him king. He sought to spare the Republic, to give the Roman people a second chance. A chance at freedom -- freedom from tyranny, from oppression. And now&hellip; Caesar had fallen, never to rise again.

                    No. <i>No</i>. He would not think of that. Not now. Not with these issues at hand. Not with&hellip; that <i>thing</i> here, corrupting his memory. Not -- now -- not&hellip; here&hellip;<br/>

                    Was he honorable? Caesar would have wanted honorable. Honor. His honor. Honor in killing Caesar -- was there? Could there have been? Was he guilty? Was he in exile in vain?

                Caesar was Brutus's best friend,

                Brutus's actions become more twisted and corrupted as the play progresses,
                (example I ?expand),
                (example II ?expand),
                Simply ignorant. Brutus demanded the conspirators maintain honor to the very end -- even if it meant letting their forces go on furlough."

                My&hellip; No. Our plans. Our plans. We meet Caesar at the steps. And he shall say -- no, he did say. No, he didn't. I have no memory of this. Why? The shade. That mist be it. The shade is&hellip; affecting my memory. But my fellows&hellip;
                Brutus was the only conspirator with pure intentions,
                The blame should not -- indeed, cannot fall to Brutus"

            <p id="refutation-2">
                Brutus betrayed his best friend -- and Caesar said so.,
                (example I ?expand),
                (example II ?expand),
                This is inconsistent with the Roman systems of thought and language&hellip;"

            <p id="body-3">
                "<i>Et tu, Brute</i> -- then fall Caesar." is not a question,
                Caesar was not expressing betrayal or bitterness,
                Caesar was recognizing Brutus's decision as valid for the greater cause of Rome,
                That is to say, Caesar's last words were a pardon unto Brutus"

                    Such claims are totally without merit, baseless, and materially false. As such, they must needs be combated at every turn, wherever they may show their ugly faces."
