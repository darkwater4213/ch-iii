# Julius Caesar To-do  

> I do not see your terminating sentences. Can you point them out to me by labeling them with a footnote?  

Done and done.  

> Your narratio looks good. You just need to add the name of the judge at the beginning of the first sentence and mention him in the last paragraph.  

This is similar to stating the thesis at the beginning of the paper: to put it simply, it feels icky. It doesn't read right. He's there, though -- You'll see him at the end.  

> I do not see your exordium. This essay you needed to integrate the kind exordium based on your judge's bias. (anecdote, clarification, or paradox)  

Sometimes you don't need one.  

> Please make these three revisions:  
>
> 1. Label your terminating sentences. If you cannot label with a footnote, then include (TS) at the end of your sentence in parenthesis.
> 2. Add your judge's name at the beginning of the address and in the conclusion.
> 3. Insert your exordium and label the judge, the bias, and the kind of exordium you used.
> (e.g. Caesar, biased for victim, A, C, or P)  
>
> Revise and resubmit.
> Blessings,

Alright...  

1. Done and done.  
2. Still feels icky. I'll put it in the printed version, but the screen version stays as-is. Deal?
3. Ah... yeah, this'll be a bir of a problem.
