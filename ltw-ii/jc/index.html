                <span id="exordium">
                    Marcus Junius Brutus was in a predicament.
                </span>
                <span id="narratio">
                    His best friend, Gaius Julius Caesar, had risen to power. He had assumed command of the Roman legions in Gaul and the surrounding areas, leading them to massive strategic victories against the various tribes in those areas. He then returned to Rome in Triumph. <!-- Literally -- a Triumph was a formal victorious military procession, usually culminating in the beheading or other execution of the conquered king. Rather grisly, if I do say so. There are some interesting historical points here, including the massive embarrassment the third and fourth Triumphs Shakespeare is here referring to -- also likely where he drew some inspiration from. --> Cassius roped Brutus into a conspiracy to bring Caesar low. To bring him to his knees &mdash; to put an end to his tyranny, once and for all. Brutus assented. After all, it was expected that the Senate was to offer Caesar the royal crown, to make him king. He sought to spare the Republic, to give the Roman people a second chance. A chance at freedom &mdash; freedom from tyranny, from oppression. And now&hellip; Caesar had fallen, never to rise again.
                </span>
                <span id="agreement">
                    It was by Brutus's hand &mdash; his very own blood-soaked hand had stabbed Caesar in the heart.
                </span>
                <span id="disagreement">
                    Was it honorable? Did he act honorably in killing Caesar? Caesar would have wanted honorable. Was there honor? Could there have been?
                </span>
                <span class="print" id="distribution">
                    Perhaps there was; Brutus was justified in killing Caesar.
                </span>
                <span class="print" id="exposition">
                    After all, he would not do so in vain or out of spite or selfish conceit. Nor did he do so alone. But most importantly -- Caesar's words to Brutus. Were they a condemnation -- or indemnification?x
                </span>
            </p>
            <p id="body-1">
                Fist of all, indeed, above all, Caesar and Brutus were very fast friends. Just below that is the Roman ideal of Honor, of which both Caesar and Brutus had a very firm grasp and adhered to most strictly. This meant that Brutus would not kill without direct intent. He wished to spare Rome &mdash; spare Rome the yoke of Caesar's rule, spare them the burden of Caesar as their king. He would not wish such agony on her; Caesar could not be permitted to ascend the throne. He made this clear to Cassius and the rest.
            </p>
            <p id="refutation-1">
                But Brutus's actions call into question his judgement, do they not? &mdash; even his sanity. His actions as the arc unfolds devolve rapidly, becoming ever more erratic, even twisted and evil. Except that this is simply not the case. Brutus demanded that the conspirators maintain the highest standard of Honor to the very end, even if it meant letting their forces go on furlough.
            </p>
            <p id="body-2">
                And Brutus did not act alone. Cassius, Casca, Cinna, Decius, Metellus, and Trebonius all were part of the plot to kill Caesar. Brutus was the only conspirator with pure intentions &mdash; and the only one who realized that Caesar's death was not necessary at the outset. But things change. Plans change. And even the greatest must fall. The blame should not &mdash; indeed, it <i>cannot</i> fall to Brutus.
            </p>
            <p id="refutation-2">
                But didn't Brutus betray his friend? He was trusted by Caesar implicitly and utterly. Caesar's last words were those of dismay and betrayal, were they not?
                "<i>Et tu, Brute,</i> &mdash; then fall Caesar!"
                But &mdash; there is no question. It is a statement. <i>And you, Brutus.</i> If Brutus says, "Thus Caesar falls," &mdash; then thus falls Caesar! The Roman ideal of Honor did not call for complaints or whining. When your friend betrays you, you take it like the Roman man you are.
            </p>
            <p id="body-3">
                He was not expressing bitterness or betrayal or dismay or pleading for mercy or help; he was very clearly assenting Brutus's decision. Caesar was recognizing Brutus's decision as for the greater cause of Rome, that is to say, Caesar's last words were a pardon unto Brutus. The great Roman general himself pardoned Brutus from any consequences resulting from his actions.
            </p>
            <p id="conclusion">
                Brutus is guilty, it is true. A pardon cannot be accepted without an admission of guilt. But Brutus's guilt was never in question: he clearly killed his fellow. But Caesar very clearly realized in his last moments that Brutus's actions were indeed Honorable &mdash; and to greater glory of Rome, not Brutus. He noted this and, in the same breath, forgave and pardoned his own killer.
                <span id="amplification">
                    Anyone who calls into question Brutus's Honor is clearly in the wrong simply by the words of the only judge who possibly could have the grounds on which to judge Brutus's actions.
