                Benedick and Beatrice in Question
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p id="introduction">
                <span id="exordium">
                    It is Messina in the sixteenth century.
                </span>
                <span id="narratio">
                    Don Pedro has stopped for a while at the house of Leonato, governor of Messina (an old friend of his), after having won a war against his half-brother, Sir Don John the Bastard. He had stopped there on his way to war as well, but this time he had the Bastard himself in tow. Upon arrival, one of Don Pedro's officers, the honorable Claudio, notices Leonato's daughter Hero, and as is the manner of shallow, immature men who neither earn nor deserve their high standing, immediately falls head over heels for her. The Bastard quite unsuccesfully attempts to break it up by rather unorthodox means. While all this is taking place, a different set of conspirators (Don Pedro, Leonato, and the honorable Claudio) decide to convince Benedick and Beatrice that they love each other.
                </span>
                <span id="agreement">
                    There are but two problems with this: Beatrice is quite nonplussed by the prospect of men in general, and Benedick is actively against the idea -- especially with Beatrice of all people.
                </span>
                <span id="disagreement">
                    Of course, there is also Beatrice's headstrong nature -- she will not give in, at least not knowingly and willingly. On the flip side of that coin is Benedick and his... <i>distaste</i> for women, Beatrice especially. Is Benedick justified in this? Or his chauvinism simply that? <!-- yeah, that sentence is... sad -->
                </span>
                <span id="distribution">
                    Today, I will prove to you that not only is Benedick justified in his chauvinism, it is wholly Beatrice's fault for alienating him like she did.
                    <!-- moar sad -->
                </span>
                <span id="exposition">
                    This I will do in three parts: firstly, Beatrice's character, secondly, Benedick's own character flaws -- and their true causes, and finally, Benedick's identity as a soldier in Don Pedro's army.
                    <!-- yep still sad -->
                </span>
            </p>
            <p id="body-1">         <!-- Beatrice   -->
                Beatrice is a problem. She insults Benedick constantly, jabbing at his ego, picking away at his goodwill. She has shown her proficiency at sparring with a truly dizzying intellect; one that can retort and will thunderously do so. And it certainly seems she hates him -- after all, she jests about their past relationship, making a mockery of something Benedick very clearly wishes she would not speak of in such a manner...
            </p>
            <p id="refutation-1">   <!-- She        -->
                She is constantly telling him that she can't stand him; she can't stand his presence or his words. When he first shows, she tells him to stop talking; no one wants to hear him speak. He responds, "Lady Disdain? I wonder tha you are yet living..."<sup>1</sup>.  Her reputation precedes her, evidently. She then publicly decries him as wretched to the point of despoiling any who come near him. In sixteenth century term, this is an insult to the utmost degree. Later, at the masked ball, she knowledgably tells him that he is a dull fool and the prince's jester. He says nothing in return, except that he would relay the information to Benedick, should he ever meet him (he was under the impression that Beatrice did not know who he was). Later at the masked ball, she insults Benedick in front of her own father and Benedick's commanding officer. Benedick excuses himself and walks away. This is clearly not Benedick's fault, but Beatrice's -- Beatrice's words and actions have driven him to the point of simply refusing to be in her presence -- and would run a trivial errand to the opposite side of the world rather than remain in her presence.
            </p>
            <p id="body-2">         <!-- Self       -->
                Which brings up Benedick's own issues. After all, he let <i>her</i> down, not the other way around. He was at fault. He didn't want to get married -- that much was clear. After all, he was a soldier, not a husband. He still is one. But his methods were far from orthodox. Even so, Beatrice wasn't telling the whole story. Far from it, in fact. Benedick was at fault. But that doesn't mean that Beatrice wasn't.
            </p>
            <p id="refutation-2">   <!-- Prince     -->
                Perhaps Beatrice wasn't too bad a catch, either. After all, Don Pedro, Benedick's commanding officer, said on several occasions that Beatrice would make a good wife for Benedick. After everyone else had left to get themselves settled in the governor's mansion, Don Pedro returned to Benedick and Claudio out front, discussing the relative merits of Hero (Beatrice's cousin). Don Pedro mentions in passing the Beatrice might make a suitable wife for Benedick, to which he replies something to the effect that he would rather have his eyes gouged out with a spoon. Don Pedro shrugs it off, but doesn't yet let the subject drop. He brings it up later, at the masked ball: he remarks that Beatrice "would make a good wife". It's not entirely clear whether he is referring to himself or Benedick (perhaps both), but his meaning is clear: as Benedick's superior officer, he approves of Beatrice as a wife.
            </p>
            <p id="body-3">         <!-- Soldier    -->
                But even though he is Benedick's commander, Don Pedro doesn't know a whole lot about love. He himself is searching for a wife; he has said as much. And so far, he has had no luck, if his lack of a companion is any indication thereof. And yet, he is somehow an authority on who Benedick should marry. On top of that, he of all people should know that as a soldier, relationships are dangerous. Soldiers are by and large single men for a reason: having the thought of a spouse, child, girlfriend, or other relation may give you something to fight <i>for</i>, but it will also distract you. It will give you something to <b>distract</b> from the heat of war; the lack of relationship is precisely what enables men to go through the horrors of war and come out the other side sane, functioning men who will live to fight another day. Don Pedro of all people should know this. Encouraging his soldiers to get married is a good way to ensure a terrible loss.
            </p>
            <p id="conclusion">
                This all points to the fact that Benedick is wholly justified in his dislike of Beatrice. She is at fault in putting him down in such a way that he is driven to the point of actively leaving her presence should she ever show up. He has an actual fear of her; a fear which he will flee from should it arise. A fear which plays on his worst nightmares<sup>2</sup>. His "chauvinism" is in fact a manifestation of that fear; on top of this is his profession preventing him from marrying, lest he should die in the heat of battle. So, he is fully justified in his animosity toward Beatrice -- he cannot help it. And nor should he.
                <span id="amplification">
                    No wonder he would shudder at the very thought of marriage -- he subconsciously realizes that it would quite literally be the death of him.
