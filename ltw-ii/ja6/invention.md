# JA6: Hamlet  

Whether Hamlet should be punished for the murder of Claudius  

## Prosecution  

Hamlet did murder Claudius.
Murder is defined as the intentional killing of another human being.
Hamlet did engage in vigilantism, but is above Danish Law Enforcement (being the Prince and all that)
Hamlet _was_ legally dependent on Claudius, but not in any material fashion.
Hamlet was seeking revenge, which is far from laudable
While his cause may have been just, his actions were not.

## Defense  

Avenging his father was the only thing Hamlet could do to put him to rest at last
His father made this clear in his speech to Hamlet in Act I

Ah, <3<3<3<3 it.
