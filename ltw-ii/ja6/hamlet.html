<h1>Hamlet</h1>
	<h2>Act 1</h2>
		<h3>Scene 1</h3>
			In this scene, Hamlet meets two watchmen at the castle gate. They reported that a ghost appeared to them at precisely midnight the previous few nights. Hamlet remains skeptical, but the ghost appears&mdash;and then vanishes again.
		<h3>Scene 2</h3>
			Now, Hamlet must trade pleasantries with various subjects, who have partly come for his father's funeral and partly for his mother's marriage to that scoundrel, Claudius. (And did she wait a full week out of respect for the dead?)
		<h3>Scene 3</h3>
			Laertes, Ophelia and Polonius have multiple discussions. Rather boring.
		<h3>Scene 4</h3>
			This time, the apparition beckons to him.
		<h3>Scene 5</h3>
			The ghost explains that it is the tortured soul of Hamlet's dead father. Hamlet's ghost (for that was Hamlet's father's name, too) told Hamlet the yet-living that he was murdered by his brother, Claudius--the very man who now occupies the throne. He demands Hamlet avenge his death.
