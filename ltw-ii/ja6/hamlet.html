<h1>Hamlet</h1>
	<h2>Act 1</h2>
		<h3>Scene 1</h3>
			In this scene, Hamlet meets two watchmen at the castle gate.
			They reported that a ghost appeared to them at precisely midnight the previous few nights.
			Hamlet remains skeptical, but the ghost appears&mdash;and then vanishes again.
		<h3>Scene 2</h3>
			Now, Hamlet must trade pleasantries with various subjects, who have partly come for his father's funeral and partly for his mother's marriage to that scoundrel, Claudius.
			(And did she wait a full week out of respect for the dead?)
		<h3>Scene 3</h3>
			Laertes, Ophelia and Polonius have multiple discussions.
			Rather boring.
		<h3>Scene 4</h3>
			This time, the apparition beckons to him.
		<h3>Scene 5</h3>
			The ghost explains that it is the tortured soul of Hamlet's dead father.
			Hamlet's ghost (for that was Hamlet's father's name, too) told Hamlet the yet-living that he was murdered by his brother, Claudius--the very man who now occupies the throne.
			He demands Hamlet avenge his death.
	<h2>Act 2</h2>
		<h3>Scene 1</h3>
			Polonius commands his servant Reynaldo to go to Paris to spy on Laertes; even use to lies if necessary.
			After, Ophelia tells Polonius that the Prince looked "piteous", which Polonius chalks up to madness brought on by his love for Ophelia.
			He then praises her for obeying him by spurning Hamlet.
			He then decides to report all this to the king.
		<h3>Scene 2</h3>
			Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two of Hamlet's childhood friends, have been hired by the king to spy on Hamlet (sound familiar?).
			The Queen assures them that they will be well-compensated and that it is all for Hamlet's good.
			Once R&G leave, Polonius claims that he has the answer to Hamlet's madness.
			But he defers to the ambassadors form Norway.
			Once he leaves, Gertrude (the Queen) scoffs at Polonius, and muses that Hamlet's state is likely due to his father's recent death&mdash;and her prompt remarriage.
		<h3>Scene 2.1</h3>
			Polonius returns with the two Norwegian ambassadors, Voltemand and Cornelius.
			They bring news of the aging Norwegian king having managed to restrain his nephew, Fortinbras the younger, from invading Denmark in the wake of his father, Fortinbras the elder's death.
			This <i>pro bono</i> gag order comes on the condition that Claudius allow Fortinbras to pass through Denmark on his campaign for Poland.
		<h3>Scene 2.2</h3>
			Polonius them immediately launches unto what can only be termed a "wheezebag orchestra"&mdash;a long-winded, philosophically dubious rant on the meaning of life ond duty.
			Polonius promises to be brief, and proceeds to sling insults at Hamlet at length, claiming that he has the reason for his madness.
			Gertrude has no patience for this ridiculousness, and chides him for it, much like she would a small child.
			He apologizes, promises to be brief, and again fails.
			He goes on about a letter Hamlet wrote to Ophelia, and criticizes every aspect, from the rhyme to the prose.
			At some point, he stops and suggests to Claudius that they two hide behind a wall hanging to spy on Hamlet and Ophelia's interactions.
			But as Claudius is about to hide himself, Hamlet walks in, and Polonius asks the king and queen to speak with the prince privately.
			Hamlet is quite clever is this scene, making fun of Polonius, who chalks his jabs up to more lovesickness.
		<h3>Scene 2.3</h3>
			(Yes, this is still Scene 2) Rosencrantz and Guildenstern then enter.
			Hamlet greets them and asks their purpose; they reluctantly divulge that the king is paying them to spy on him.
			Rosencrantz jumps at the opportunity to introduce the players' troupe that had just arrived.
			Hamlet's mood swings yet again.
			Polonius, ever the redundant fool, also enters to introduce the players.
			When they enter (this is quite the scene), Hamlet asks the lead player to perform a speech from the _Aeneid_.
			The player ends up moving himself to tears (he's either that good, or that bad.
			Who knows?), and Polonius leaves to show the players to their chambers.
			But a few are left, and Hamlet asks some of them to put on _The Murder of Gonzago_, but with a few modifications of his own.
			They leave, and Hamlet reveals his intentions: the players are going to reenact the murder the ghost described, in the hopes that Claudius's reaction will prove his guilt&mdash;and the ghost's credibility.
	<h2>Act 3</h2>
		<h3>Scene 1.1</h3>
			R&G deliver their report of Hamlet's behavior, but appear to be hiding something.
			Claudius starts to mention this, but Gertrude blows him off.
			Ophelia and Polonius also present themselves, and nothing interesting happens, other than Polonius imitating a jellyfish&mdash;or is that just Polonius?
		<h3>Scene 1.2</h3>
			They all <i>withdraw</i>, and Hamlet enters and delivers his infamous "To be or not to be" soliloquy.
			Ophelia enters, and Hamlet wholesale rejects her.
			This calls into question whether Hamlet's monologue is actually in earnest, or merely to keep up the ruse of his being mad.
			This exchange also contains the infamous "Get thee to a nunnery!" lines.
		<h3>Scene 1.3</h3>
			Finally, the king decides that Hamlet would better served in England&mdash;to die, that is.
			He relates this to Polonius, who presents no objection.
		<h3>Scene 2.1</h3>
			Hamlet and three players appear to set up for the play.
			This is rather a confusing part of the scene.
		<h3>Scene 2.2</h3>
			The actual play&mdash;an obvious reenactment of the events in Elsinore.
			The David Tenant version of the play has a quite amusing rendition of this.
			Needless to say, the ploy works perfectly: Claudius calls for lights and storms out of the hall.
			This also has the famous line, "The lady doth protest too much, methinks." This is Gertrude, referring to the Player Queen.
			Likely said out of guilt and shame.
		<h3>Scene 2.3</h3>
			Horatio, Hamlet, and R&G warp things up by joking around and playing recorders (at Hamlet's insistence) after the players and royalty have left.
			A fat jellyfish then comes, telling Hamlet that his mother sends for him, and wishes to speak with him "in [her] closet".
			Rather a poor choice of words...
		<h3>Scene 3.1</h3>
			Claudius and R&G rendezvous; rather uninteresting.
			R&G are then replaced with a certain fattened jellyfish, to tell the king that he is to snoop on Hamlet's private conversation with his own mother (is nothing sacred?).
		<h3>Scene 3.2</h3>
			Claudius appears to <i>almost</i> have a change of heart.
			He even confesses his sins, and gets on his knees to pray.
			Naturally, Shakespeare has Hamlet creep up behind Claudius at that very moment, knife ready&mdash;and nothing.
			Hamlet can't bring himself to condemn Claudius to an afterlife in Heaven.
			So he withdraws, and decides that he'll do the deed when Claudius is in thu midst of utter debauchery, to ensure his damnation is Hell (that's Catholicism for you).
		<h3>Scene 4</h3>
			Polonius schemes his jellyish way behind a curtain in Gertrude's room.
			Hamlet enters, and promptly accuses his mother.
			I'd make a comment about his rudeness, but he's right&mdash;and such a comment simply has no factual ground to stand on.
			At some point in the verbal brawl, Polonius decides to cry out "Help!".
			Hamlet, incorrectly presuming that it is Claudius behind the curtain, cries "A rat! A rat!" and stabs him.
			Frankly, David Tenant did it better with Polonius being shot through a rotating mirror, cracking it in rather a distinctive fashion, to serve as a sort af altar of reflection throughout the rest of the film (pardon the pun).
			Hamlet and Gertrude exchange more words, Hamlet receives another ghostly visitation (convincing Gertrude that he is mad indeed), then Hamlet drags Polonius's corpse from the room.
	<h2>Act 4</h2>
		<h3>Scene 1</h3>
			Gertrude relates to Claudius what Hamlet has done: cry "A rat! A rat!", then stab Polonius "with his rapier" (though no version of the play actually has Hamlet use a rapier; it's always a dagger.
			Who knows why? Perhaps Gertrude just doesn't know her blades very well.) Claudius decides that Hamlet must be shipped of at once, even before dawn breaks.
			Claudius then calls R&G, and tells them to find and apprehend Hamlet for killing Polonius.
		<h3>Scene 2</h3>
			This is rather a humorous scene, in which R&G confront Hamlet about Polonius and ask him where the body is.
			Hamlet responds with brilliant wordplay and insults against both the king and the jellyfish.
		<h3>Scene 3</h3>
			More brilliant wordplay at Claudius's expense results when he vainly tries to interrogate&mdash;or perhaps intimidate&mdash;Hamlet an to where Polonius is.
		<h3>Scene 4</h3>
			This is rather an odd scene, in which R&G, Hamlet, and Fortinbras (of Norway) meet.
			Noting truly significant appears to happen, and the meaning of this scene is rather unclear.
			Perhaps the intent is that Fortinbras intercepted Hamlet as he was being shipped off?
		<h3>Scene 5</h3>
			A rather disturbing scene, in which Ophelia's slow descent into madness is characterized by her obsession with flowers, incessant singing, and general yelling, unruliness, and disheveled manner.
			At some point, a man comes in bringing news of a revolt, demanding that Laertes be king.
			Laertes himself then appears, threatening the king and demanding that he return Laertes his father.
			Claudius, to his credit (he knows his life is already forfeit) doesn't even bat an eye at the gun pointed directly at it.
			This Danish standoff is suddenly interrupted by Ophelia's entrance, flinging flowers of some import (there's a lot more meaning there than most people realize, most of it rather scathing) at everyone.
			Laertes breaks down at the sight of his sister in such a state.
			Laertes is quick to agree to Claudius's terms (quite the diplomatic turnaround).
		<h3>Scene 6</h3>
			Horatio receives some letters from "seafaring men" (read: Danish pirates) who have evidently captured the ship Hamlet was on, and intend to return him to Elsinore.
			Horatio seems oddly nonplussed by this news.
		<h3>Scene 7</h3>
			Claudius and Laertes conspire against Hamlet, but Gertrude interrupts them with the news that Ophelia has just drowned herself.
			Laertes is incensed; Hamlet is now responsible for the deaths of his father and his sister&mdash;and again, agrees to Claudius's terms.
			Claudius is <i>quite</i> the diplomat.
	<h2>Act 5</h2>
		<h3>Scene 1.1</h3>
			A quick banter takes place between two gravediggers, revealing some more of the circumstances surrounding Ophelia's death.
			One of them leaves, and is replaced by Hamlet (with Horatio as a sort of floater, I suppose).
			More banter takes place, which eventually leads Hamlet to mull over the meaning of life once more.
			This eventually leads his to ask whose a certain skull is.
			The sexton replies that it is the skull of Yorick, the old king Hamlet's jester.
			Various details in this exchange show that Hamlet is around thirty years old, although this couldn't be the case if he were denied the crown.
			Ah, well&mdash;Shakespeare writes as Shakespeare does.
		<h3>Scene 1.2</h3>
			The funeral procession marches in, with Claudius, Gertrude, Laertes, and the late Ophelia (it has yet to be explicitly revealed that Ophelia is the girl to be buried, so Hamlet does not yet know that Ophelia is dead).
			At any rate, Laertes jumps into the grave, saying that he should be buried along with his sister; that the very mountains should cover them both for eternity.
			Naturally, Hamlet has something of a reaction to this news.
			Hamlet essentially takes Laertes's place, and the whole thing repeats.
			Claudius, at the end of all this, pulls Laertes aside and tells him to wait; the duel will come.
		<h3>Scene 2</h3>
			(Skipping the stuff with Osric) The <s>stage</s> strip is set.
			Hamlet scores the first point, and Gertrude, despite Claudius's protestations, toasts to Hamlet's health (oh, the irony!).
			At some point in the match, Laertes breaks skin with the poisoned sword (perhaps a foil, perhaps a saber), and Hamlet realizes that he is poisoned.
			Gertrude swoons, and announces that she has been poisoned by the cup of wine reserved for (who could have guessed) Hamlet.
			In a somewhat unintelligible whirlwind of action, almost everyone dies, one way or another, except Horatio.
			Fortinbras invades, orders the proper rites, and claims kingship.
			Curtain.
