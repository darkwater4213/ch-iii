Laws: Part II 
Key Terms: 

CAUSE - An external force that moves or influences a person to act or react in a given manner. The manner in which a person commits an act: intentionally, accidentally, by compulsion, or with premeditation. In some cases it excuses an act, in other cases it calls for admonishment. 

MOTIVE - The internal forces (hopes, fears, or desires) that lead a person to act in a given way. The reason a person commits an act; in some cases it justifies the act, in other cases it calls for admonishment. 

EXCUSE - An appeal to a cause to explain whether the behavior/action is understandable. 

JUSTIFICATION - An appeal to a motive to explain whether the behavior/action is right. 

NATURAL LAW - A generally recognized principle or rule governing human behavior. 

CUSTOMARY LAW - A law established by a particular community; can be written or unwritten. 
Practice

Express the issue, using a legally neutral verb, in the form, “Whether X should be admonished for Y.”		


ASSUME THE ROLE OF THE PROSECUTION
Put on your prosecutor's hat and record your information in the A or N column, or put it on a separate paper if you find it helpful or necessary. Use the tables and questions from earlier lessons as needed. 

Use quid sit and quale sit to further develop the case for the prosecution. 

Quid Sit: Determine the laws broken. 
What natural laws were broken, if any? (Refer to Hierarchy of Laws Table on p. 117 for more details and examples of these laws.) 

Laws of reverence: laws that apply to those you are dependent on

Laws of equity: laws that apply to peers
Laws of benevolence: laws that apply to your dependents
What customary laws were broken, if any? (Refer to Hierarchy of Laws Table on p. 117 for more details and examples of these laws.) 
 
Laws of covenant: contracts between two or more people
Laws of statue: legislation form the government
Laws of tradition: customs handed down informally from earlier generations

Quale Sit: Determine the causes and motives of the defendant's action. 
Cause: Did the defendant know the law he was breaking?
Cause: Did the defendant break the law willingly?
Did he break the law by chance? Explain how.
Did he break the law by compulsion? Explain how. Is that a sufficient excuse? Explain.

Did he break the law out of habit? Explain how. Is that a sufficient excuse? Explain. 

Did he break the law by premeditation or plan? Explain how. Is that a sufficient excuse? Explain. 

Motive: Why did the defendant commit the act?  Was he trying to:
Gain a profit or avoid loss?
Gain revenge or reward?
Gain someone's punishment? 
Achieve his own pleasure or desire? 

Motive: Is the defendant's action justified? 
Is there a higher law he kept that justifies the defendant's action? (See the Hierarchy of Laws Table on p. 117 for more details and examples of ideas.) 
2. Sort the A column

3. Assess the A column for the prosecution to determine three arguments that convincingly argue that the defendant broke a law without a sufficient excuse. The three arguments must answer the questions: 
Did he do it (an sit)? 
Did the action break a law (quid sit)?
Why is the action inexcusable or unjustifiable (quale sit)? 

REMINDER: If you choose to prosecute, you must prove all three: an sit, quid sit, and quale sit. 


5 . List the best an sit, quid sit, and quale sit argument.

ASSUME THE ROLE OF THE DEFENSE
Change hats. To defend your defendant, conduct a skeptical/hostile evaluation of the prosecution's case, asking the questions below. Record your answers under N on the ANI chart. 

For the prosecution's an sit arguments, ask:

Is the evidence factually correct? Explain.
Is there counter-evidence (e.g., an alibi)? Describe.
If the combined evidence is not convincing, explain how the conclusion is not logically necessary. 

For the prosecution's quid sit arguments, ask:

Do you acknowledge that the defendant broke the law? 
Is there some way the specific action kept the law?

For the prosecution's quale sit arguments, ask:

What external force caused the defendant to act?
Was the act excusable (i.e., is there something about him or his past that requires our mercy)?
What was the defendant's motive (what did he hope for or fear)?
Was the act justifiable (i.e., was it right in some way)?

  
Sort  the Negative/Defense column.

Identify three arguments that convincingly demonstrate that the defendant did not do what he is accused of (an sit), did not break a law (quid sit), and/or had an excuse or was justified in his action (quale sit). Remember, to successfully defend the accused, the defense must defeat only one of the prosecution's arguments, but can address more than one.     

List the best three defense arguments that demonstrate the prosecution's weakness: 


After you have refined your case using the Arrangement Lesson in JA5, you will choose a thesis. If the defense's case adequately exposes the weaknesses in the prosecution's case, then you will defend. If it does not, you will prosecute. 

N.B. Do not decide whether to prosecute or defend until your case and refutation are refined in the JA5 Arrangement lesson. 
 



HIERARCHY OF LAWS TABLE 

A defendant sometimes appeals to one law to justify breaking another. This is called the appeal to higher law. 

Below are two different hierarchies of law: the Roman Table and the Hebrew Table. The Roman Table represents the hierarchical order that seems implied by Cicero. The Hebrew Table represents the hierarchical order that seems implied by the HEbrew tradition. Both the defense and the prosecution may find these tables useful when they reflect on whether the defendant's action can be justified.

ROMAN TABLE  (from the highest law at the top to the lowest at the bottom)

Laws of Nature
Religion - honor to God
Duty - honor to homeland and family
Gratitude - honor to giver, patron
Vengeance - honor for victim
Reverence - honor to a superior or authority
Truth - honor to facts

Laws of Custom 
	Law of Covenant - agreement between persons
	Law of Equity - fairness to others
	Law of Statute - written law or understood customs

HEBREW TABLE  (from the highest law at the top to the lowest at the bottom)

Law of Reverence
	To God
	To Family
	To Authority
Law of Benevolence 
	To Poor
	To Orphans/Widows
	To Servants

Law of Equity

Special Topic:
Evidence
Key Terms: 

AN SIT -  (whether a thing is) - A special topic that helps students collect evidence to determine whether an act occurred and whether the defendant committed the act.

EVIDENCE - Any information used by the prosecution or defense in a judicial address to prove the defendant did or did not commit the act. It includes physical evidence and personal evidence. 

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE - The facts, data, and physical things (forensics) that indicate the guilt or innocence of the defendant. 

PERSONAL EVIDENCE 
EYEWITNESS - Anyone who witnesses the act or the circumstances in which it occurred, or who can provide an alibi for the defendant (i.e., testify to the defendant's absence. “Alibi” is Latin for elsewhere.”).

EXPERT WITNESS - A person with the authority to interpret the physical evidence and determine whether it supports the case for the prosecution or the case for the defense. 

CHARACTER WITNESS - A person who can testify to the quality of another person's character (i.e., virtues and/or vices). 

RELEVANT - An attribute of evidence that pertains to, or sustains, the argument to which it is applied. (“Material” means it matters, so “immaterial evidence” does not matter because it is irrelevant.) 

RELIABLE - An attribute of physical evidence that is what the prosecution or defense claims it to be. The evidence proves what they say it proves. 

CREDIBLE - An attribute of testimony that is what the witness claims it to be. It is “believable.” 
LEGALLY NEUTRAL - Presumes innocence till someone is proven guilty. For example, we might begin with “neglecting a plant” rather than “killing a plant.” We might begin with the verb “taking” rather than “stealing.” Use a legally neutral verb in your issue from now on.
