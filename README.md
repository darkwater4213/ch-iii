Considering that you're likely only reading this if you are one of three groups of people (my parents, my teachers, or my classmates for whatever reason), I'm going to be writing this to those people. If you're not... there's nothing here for you other than assorted tongue-in-cheek essays. People who stumbled across here from random dark corners of the internet aren't the intended audience per se.  

So. Now that most of you are gone (and if you're not, maybe you should be), here goes. If you're not sure where you're supposed to be looking, that's okay. I will likely have sent you a link to whatever you're looking for. If not, just ask me. If you don't have a link, you can ask me on Discord.  

If you don't know my discord handle, then you can either a) ask me in person or b) Leave! Now! And NEVER come BACK! (Tell me where is Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with him).  

There is also an option c) mess around until you find something interesting.  

Other than that... uh, please [don't pass off any of my work as your own.](LICENSE)
